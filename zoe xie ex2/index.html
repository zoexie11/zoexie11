<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p class="intro">
My favorite dog is <strong>West Highland White Terrier</strong>, The <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/west-highland-white-terrier/" target="_blank"> West Highland White Terrier </a> is a small, playful, determined terrier with a good artistic temperament, very conceited, sturdy body construction, deep chest and back, straight back, powerful hindquarters, and muscular legs, showing a combination of great strength and vitality. Coat about 2 inches long, white, hard, with a thick soft undercoat.

<p class="intro">
<em>Do NOT give chocolate to dogs.</em> Chocolate can be fatal to dogs. Theobromine is an ingredient that stimulates the heart muscle and central nervous system, leading to chocolate poisoning. Understanding common dog diseases and breeding behaviors can help dogs grow healthier. The grooming of dog hair in daily care can make the dog image and temperament good.
